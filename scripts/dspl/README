This directory contains the scripts for Google's Public Explorer [1].
It is typically used to simplify the visualization of datasets.

It is based on the Google's DSPL [2].

The data within (in the CSVs) contains some of the observations of CSO.

The DSPL dataset description file (an XMLf file) and CSVs are compiled
by using SPARQL queries to retrieve observations in RDF/XML and applying XSLT.
