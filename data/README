The dataset for DataGov IE is generated from http://github.com/csarven/ie-linked-data

This directory contains extras.ttl file with additional triples.
The intention is to keep a cached copy, instead of dereferencing every time.
They are considered to be static, non-changing statements 
e.g., sdmx-code's sex-F has label "Female", or lat/long of a city.

See also the void.ttl file in base directory.
